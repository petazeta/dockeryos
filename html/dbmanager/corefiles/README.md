## Getting started

There it is the database tables. Click on the tables and then you can navigate under rows and its relationships. You can create, delete and modify, also you can remove links and add links (relationship between elements)


## Troubleshooting

If the database connection is not working you may need to check settings at server/php/cfg/config.php or server/nodejs/cfg/dbcfg.json.

If it doesn't allow admin to make changes you can try to copy server/utils/htaccess file to the folder server/php and rename it to ".htaccess".
